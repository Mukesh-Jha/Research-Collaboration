# Research-Collaboration
Problem Statement:
• Currently, there is no efficient system in place at NIT Trichy to collate, organize, and provide easy access to the extensive body of research work undertaken by students and faculty across various disciplines.
• The lack of a comprehensive database hinders knowledge sharing, collaboration, and the potential for leveraging past research to enhance the quality and scope of future projects.
• Addressing these challenges is critical to fostering a culture of research excellence, innovation, and continuous learning within the university community.
List of Stakeholders:
1.	Students looking for project ideas.
2.	Research scholars/students uploading their research work.
3.	Research Faculty for Supervision and Research.

The DataBase System aims at bridging this gap and bolster cross collaboration for research.

I am presently working towards using this data collated to gather insights into major areas of research and many other insights into the process of research at NIT Trichy itself.
